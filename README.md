# PredatorPreyProgram
Simple Agent-base Predator Prey Model Program

Current Progress:
1. Simple UI working (added simple results page)
2. set up of both wolves and sheep (working now)
3. Animals can move around during a timestep and wolves lose energy on move
4. Set up of map
5. Animals can reproduce based on percentage
6. Animals can die
7. Wolves can eat sheep 

Things to do:
1. Add live graph or at least some display of count of sheep and wolves per tick
2. Fix eating system so that sheep energy is transferred to wolf that ate it.
3. Fix creation system so animals get proper initial stats.

Possible extensions to try:
1. allow for a food chain system (ie. something eats wolves who eat sheep)
