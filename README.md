# PredatorPreyProgram
Simple Agent-base Predator Prey Model Program

Current Progress:
1. Simple UI working
2. set up of both wolves and sheep
3. Animals can move around during a timestep and wolves lose energy on move
4. Set up of map
5. Animals can reproduce based on percentage
6. Animals can die
7. Wolves can eat sheep (energy can transfer)
8. JFreeChart connected and works as a JPanel(XYPLot works)

Things to do:
1. Fix creation system so animals get proper initial stats.
2. Test eating system so that sheep energy is transferred to wolf that ate it properly. (Needs more testing)
3. Add proper default value numbers for options page and change value range based on NetLogo Model (DONE)
4. Add option to choose how long to run system and some loading text to state system is running
5. Decide UI flow of system 
6. Test overall system

Possible extensions to try:
1. allow for a food chain system (ie. something eats wolves who eat sheep)
2. Optimize structure and flow of systems within program (eating,moving,etc)
