# PredatorPreyProgram
Simple Agent-base Predator Prey Model Program

Current Progress:
1. Simple UI working
2. set up of both wolves and sheep
3. Animals can move around during a timestep and wolves lose energy on move
4. Set up of map
5. Animals can reproduce based on percentage
6. Animals can die
7. Wolves can eat sheep (energy can transfer)
8.JFreeChart connected and works as a JPanel

Things to do:
1. Add proper live graph(XYPlot) or at least some display of count of sheep and wolves per tick (simple number results page exist but not connected)
2. Test eating system so that sheep energy is transferred to wolf that ate it properly.
3. Fix creation system so animals get proper initial stats.
4. Test overall system

Possible extensions to try:
1. allow for a food chain system (ie. something eats wolves who eat sheep)
