# PredatorPreyProgram
Simple Agent-base Predator Prey Model Program

Current Progress:
1. Simple UI working (no live graph)
2. set up of both wolves and sheep(not completely accurate e.g sheep does not get random energy based on initial number)
3. Animals can move around during a timestep and wolves lose energy on move
4. Set up of map
5. Animals can reproduce based on percentage (need to create death and eating for system to work properly)
6. Animals can die
7. Wolves can eat sheep (system of transfering energy does not work)


Possible extensions to try:
1. allow for a food chain system (ie. something eats wolves who eat sheep)
