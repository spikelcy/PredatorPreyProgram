# PredatorPreyProgram
Simple Agent-base Predator Prey Model Program

Current Progress:
1. Simple UI working (no live graph)
2. set up of both wolves and sheep(not completely accurate)
3. Animals can move around during a timestep
4. Set up of map
5. Animals can reproduce based on percentage (need to create death and eating for system to work properly)


Possible extensions to try:
1. allow for a food chain system (ie. something eats wolves who eat sheep)
